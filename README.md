## Description 

For this project I worked in MongoDB, Express and Mongoose to create the backend for a social networking site. This NoSQL database was created to handle large amounts of data with various points of intersection.

* User routes include: Get, GetAll, Post, Put and Delete, and Post and Delete friends of users

* Thought routes include: Get, GetAll, Post, Put and Delete, and Post and Delete reactions to thoughts
